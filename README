## AABB Collision Resoultion

<https://nightblade9.github.io/godot-gamedev/2020/a-primer-on-aabb-collision-resolution.html>

1) Detect if objects are about to collide.
2) Calculate distance between objects about to collide.
3) Smallest distance tells us which axis will collide first.
4) Resolve collision on axis that collide first.
